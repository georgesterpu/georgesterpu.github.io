I am a research expert in the areas of Machine Learning and Audio-Visual Speech Processing, with 8+ years of work experience in both academia and the industry. My career goal is to invent and develop technologies that can help humans solve hard problems. 

While I dedicated myself to science and engineering for the first part of my life, in recent years I started exploring new domains outside my formal education, discovering a genuine passion for learning new concepts and for connecting ideas across disciplines. 

My current hobbies are running, reading non-fiction books (in medicine, neuroscience, psychology, business, biographies), playing tennis, and hiking.
