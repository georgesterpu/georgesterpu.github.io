Questions proposed by Brad Stulberg in the final chapter of his book "Master of Change".

### 1. Where in your life are you pursuing fixity where it might be beneficial to open yourself to the possibility—or in some cases, the inevitability—of change?

### 2. In what parts of your life are you holding on to unrealistic expectations?

### 3. Are there elements of your identity to which you cling too tightly?

### 4. How might you use your core values—the rugged and flexible boundaries of your identity—to help you navigate the challenges in your life?

### 5. In what circumstances do you tend to react when you would benefit from responding, and what conditions predispose you to that?
