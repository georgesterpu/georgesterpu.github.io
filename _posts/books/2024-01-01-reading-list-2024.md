<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/entrepreneur_revolution.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "You will probably just spend a whole lifetime making sacrifices, and then get resentful that you're too old to do the things that really matter to you. If you continue to sacrifice, you will probably realise after it's too late that a great life is made up of great days. New idea: there is no payday, there is just life."

</div>
> "As Dr Burgelman, a famous Stanford business school professor said, it is far better to understand why you failed than to be ignorant of why you succeeded."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

- **3. Six Sales Skills Everyone Should Know** by Stefanie Boyer
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/sixsales.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "You can ask leading questions, like 'What happened in your day today that was surprising?' or other open-ended questions to understand what happened in a situation. Too often, we get vague answers because our questions aren't as thoughtful or as probing as they could be."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

- **5. The Ride of a Lifetime** by Robert Iger
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/rideofalifetime.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "I can't do anything about the past. We can talk about lessons learnt, and we can make sure we apply those lessons going forward, but we don't get any do-overs. You want to know where I am taking this company, not where it's been. Here's my plan."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

- **6. Start with Why** by Simon Sinek
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/why.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


- **7. The Lean Startup** by Eric Ries
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/leanstartup.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "We have the capacity to build almost anything we can imagine. The big question of our time is not Can it be built? but Should it be built? As Peter Drucker said, 'There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.'"
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


- **8. Conversationally Speaking** by Alan Garner
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/conversationally.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "Shaking hands. Your posture. Facial expressions. Your appearance. Voice tone. Hair style. Your clothes. The expression in your eyes. Your smile. How close you stand to others. How you listen. Your confidence. Your breathing. The way you move. The way you stand. How you touch other people. These aspects of you affect your relationship with other people, often without you and them realising it. The body talks. Its message is how you really are, now how you think you are."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

- **9. Never Split the Difference** by Chris Voss
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/neversplit.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "As you try to insert the tools of tactical empathy into your daily life, I encourage you to think of them as extensions of natural human interactions, and not artificial conversational tricks. In any interaction it pleases us to feel that the other side is listening and acknowledging our situation, whether you are negotiating a business deal or simply chatting to the person at the supermarket butcher counter, creating an empathetic relationship and encouraging your counterpart to expand on that situation is the basis of healthy human interaction. These tools, then, are nothing less than emotional best practices that help you cure the pervasive ineptitude that marks our most critical conversations in life. They will help you connect and create more meaningful and warm relationships. That they might help you extract what you want is a bonus. Human connection is the first goal."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


- **10. Surrounded by Idiots** by Thomas Erikson
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/surrounded.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "You help other people understand you by creating a secure arena for communication—on their terms. Then the listener can use his energy to understand rather than to consciously or unconsciously react to your manner of communicating. All of us need to develop our flexibility and so be able to vary our style of communication, adapting it when we speak to people who are different from us. By adjusting yourself to how other people want to be treated, you become more effective in your communication."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


- **11. The Infinite Game** by Simon Sinek
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/infinite.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "We are the finite players in the infinite game of life. No matter how much money we make, no matter how much power we accumulate, no matter how many promotions we are given, none of us will ever be declared the winner of life. In the game of life, the only choice we get is if we want to play with a finite mindset or an infinite mindset. If we choose to live our lives with a finite mindset, it means we make our primary purpose to get richer, or promoted faster than others. To live our lives with an infinite mindset means that we are driven to advance a cause bigger than ourselves."
> "True trusting relationships require both parties to take a risk, like dating or making friends. Though one person has to take a first risk to trust, the other person has to reciprocate at some point if the relationship has any chance of succeeding. "

- **12. Dear Dolly** by Dolly Alderton
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/deardolly.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "The last time I was getting over someone, a very wise friend said to me gently: 'You know, no one should have the power to ruin your life by breaking up with you.' He was right, of course. If you're in a relationship where you think your entire purpose or self-esteem is dependent on the fact of the other person loving you for ever, something has gone wrong. My life was never their property to ruin, just as you should never feel like his is yours. Now is the time to be brave and honest. He will find love again, just like you will, and both of you will be grateful that you made the decision to end a relationship that wasn’t right. You are allowing him to find someone to be with who really wants to be with him. One day he’ll know that was the real act of kindness."

- **13. Stolen Focus** by Johann Hari
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/stolenfocus.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "We told ourselves that we could have a massive expansion in the amount of information we are exposed to, and the speed with which it hits us, with no cost. This is a delusion. It becomes exhausting. More importantly, what we are sacrificing is depth in all sorts of dimensions. Depth takes time, and depth takes reflection. If you have to keep up with everything, and send emails all the time, there's no time to reach depth. Depth connected to work in your relationships also takes time, it takes energy, it takes long timespans, and it takes commitment. It takes attention. All of these things that require depth are suffering. It's pulling us more and more up onto the surface."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

- **14. Bigger Than Us** by Fearne Cotton
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/bigger.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "Whatever we think, and then believe, is what we create in our life. Often we lose connection to that something bigger by no more than our self-limiting beliefs, and our self-limiting beliefs can only enter the room when love is absent. The law of attraction brings us back to a place where anything is possible, because we believe we are connected to something other than our own minds."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

- **15. Find Your Why** by Simon Sinek
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/findyourwhy.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "For those who work for an organisation that does not leave you feeling inspired at the beginning and end of every day, you must become the leader you wish you had."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

- **16. The Diary of a CEO** by Steven Bartlett
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/diaryceo.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "Being off target by one degree will lead to a plane missing its end destination by one mile for every 60 miles flown. Week after week, my inbox is flooded with messages from individuals who've found themselves lost in their careers, their businesses, their relationships, and their friendships. In nearly every instance, it eventually becomes evident that their present circumstances are a consequence of neglecting small things for an extended period of time. They fail to check in with themselves and others, to speak up, to engage in difficult conversations, or to address the seemingly trivial issues in their lives."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

- **17. The Fearless Organization** by Amy C. Edmondson
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/fearless.png" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "Stop to consider which mindset is in charge when you’re at work. How often do you find yourself truly playing to win? It can be challenging to make this shift, because when you play not to lose, you’re likely to succeed (in not losing). But you miss opportunities to grow, to innovate, and to experience a deeper sense of fulfillment."
