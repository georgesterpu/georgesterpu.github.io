</div>
> "You will probably just spend a whole lifetime making sacrifices, and then get resentful that you're too old to do the things that really matter to you. If you continue to sacrifice, you will probably realise after it's too late that a great life is made up of great days. New idea: there is no payday, there is just life."

</div>
> "You can ask leading questions, like 'What happened in your day today that was surprising?' or other open-ended questions to understand what happened in a situation. Too often, we get vague answers because our questions aren't as thoughtful or as probing as they could be."

<img src="/img/book_covers/rideofalifetime.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "I can't do anything about the past. We can talk about lessons learnt, and we can make sure we apply those lessons going forward, but we don't get any do-overs. You want to know where I am taking this company, not where it's been. Here's my plan."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

- **6. Start with Why** by Simon Sinek
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/why.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


- **7. The Lean Startup** by Eric Ries
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/leanstartup.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "We have the capacity to build almost anything we can imagine. The big question of our time is not Can it be built? but Should it be built? As Peter Drucker said, 'There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.'"
<div style="clear: both;"></div>


- **8. Conversationally Speaking** by Alan Garner
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/conversationally.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "Shaking hands. Your posture. Facial expressions. Your appearance. Voice tone. Hair style. Your clothes. The expression in your eyes. Your smile. How close you stand to others. How you listen. Your confidence. Your breathing. The way you move. The way you stand. How you touch other people. These aspects of you affect your relationship with other people, often without you and them realising it. The body talks. Its message is how you really are, now how you think you are."
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

- **9. Never Split the Difference** by Chris Voss
<div class="image-container">
<img src="/img/book_covers/neversplit.jpg" width="100" alt="image unavailable">
</div>
> "As you try to insert the tools of tactical empathy into your daily life, I encourage you to think of them as extensions of natural human interactions, and not artificial conversational tricks. In any interaction it pleases us to feel that the other side is listening and acknowledging our situation, whether you are negotiating a business deal or simply chatting to the person at the supermarket butcher counter, creating an empathetic relationship and encouraging your counterpart to expand on that situation is the basis of healthy human interaction. These tools, then, are nothing less than emotional best practices that help you cure the pervasive ineptitude that marks our most critical conversations in life. They will help you connect and create more meaningful and warm relationships. That they might help you extract what you want is a bonus. Human connection is the first goal."
